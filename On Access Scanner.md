Incident Logic: With exception of PUAs, all events should be raised as incidents.

Bitdefender provides continuous, real-time protection against a wide range of malware threats by scanning all accessed files, e-mail messages and the communications through Instant Messaging Software applications (ICQ, NetMeeting, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger).

The machine learning based scanning engine ensures protection against malware, with minor impact on system performance. You can easily change the real-time protection settings according to your needs by switching to one of the predefined protection levels. Or, if you are an advanced user, you can configure the scan settings in detail by creating a custom protection level.
